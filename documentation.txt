How to run this solution:

- Upload the CloudFormation YAML to S3 and generate the stack launch URL.

- Launch the stack using the URL (creates the IAM role).

- Create an EC2 instance and attach the role ReadOnlyAccessRole as instance profile.

- SSH into the EC2 instance or use SSM.

- Install Python and Boto3 if not already installed.

- Upload and run the script:
  - python3 fetch_inventory.py
